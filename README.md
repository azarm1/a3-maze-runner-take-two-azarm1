## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the foundational maze-solving software originally developed by Alexandre Lachance. 
Enhancements including the integration of maze graph representations, the BFS method for pathfinding, and performance measurement 
features were developed by Maya Azar.

## Business Logic Specification

This program explores a maze, finding a path from an entry point to an exit one.

- The maze is stored in a text file, with `#` representing walls and `␣` (_empty space_) representing passages.
- You’ll find examples of such mazes in the [`examples`](./examples) directory.
    - You can also use the [Maze Generator](https://github.com/ace-lectures/maze-gen) to generate others.
- The Maze is surrounded by walls on its four borders, except for its entry/exit points.
    - Entry and exit points are always located on the East and West border.
    - The maze is not directed. As such, exit and entry can be interchanged.
- At the beginning of the exploration, we're located on the entry tile, facing the opposite side (e.g., if entering by
  the eastern entry, you're facing West).
- The program generates a sequence of instructions to reach the opposite exit (i.e., a "path"):
    - `F` means 'move forward' according to your current direction
    - `R` means 'turn right' (does not move, just change direction), and `L` means ‘turn left’.
- A canonical path contains only `F`, `R` and `L` symbols
- A factorized path squashes together similar instructions (i.e., `FFF` = `3F`, `LL` = `2L`).
- Spaces are ignored in the instruction sequence (only for readability: `FFLFF` = `FF L FF`)
- The program takes as input a maze and print the path on the standard output.
    - For this assignment, the path does not have to be the shortest one.
- The program can take a path as input and verify if it's a legit one.

## How to run this software?

To build the program, simply package it with Maven:

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % mvn -q clean package 
```

### Provided version (starter code)

The starter code assumes the maze file name is the first argument.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar ./examples/small.maz.txt
** Starting Maze Runner
**** Reading the maze from file ./examples/small.maz.txt

```

When called on a non-existing file. it prints an error message

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar ./examples/small.maz.txtd
** Starting Maze Runner
**** Reading the maze from file ./examples/small.maz.txtd
/!\ An error has occured /!\

** End of MazeRunner
```

### Delivered version

The enhanced Maze Runner includes additional functionalities and command-line arguments to cater to advanced maze-solving scenarios, including performance comparisons and support for multiple pathfinding algorithms.

#### Command line arguments

The delivered program uses the following flags:

- `-i MAZE_FILE`: specifies the filename to be used;
- `-p PATH_SEQUENCE`: activates the path verification mode to validate that PATH_SEQUENCE is correct for the maze
- `-method {tremaux, righthand, bfs} `: Selects the pathfinding algorithm to use. Default is bfs.
- `-baseline {method_name}` : Compares the selected method's performance against a baseline method.


#### Examples

When no logs are activated, the programs only print the computed path on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt
4F
mosser@azrael A1-Template %
```

If a given path is correct, the program prints the message `correct path` on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt -p 4F
correct path
mosser@azrael A1-Template %
```

If a given path is incorrect, the program prints the message `incorrect path` on the standard output.

```
mosser@azrael A1-Template % java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/straight.maz.txt -p 3F
inccorrect path
mosser@azrael A1-Template %

Upon execution, the program dynamically chooses between traditional maze exploration and graph-based analysis based on the specified pathfinding method. It then performs pathfinding operations, outputting the path found and, if applicable, comparing its performance against a baseline method.

Example using Trémaux's algorithm against BFS as the baseline:

```shell
mayaazar$ java -jar target/mazerunner.jar -i ./examples/giant.maz.txt -method "tremaux" -baseline "BFS"
